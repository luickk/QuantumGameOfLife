# QuantumGameOfLife

-- written in Jave because I needed a reason (this project) to do something in Jave for CS tests -- 

A Game Of Life version with (approximate or "quantum like") Quantum rules (probably the Dirac Equation). And yes, I do realize that it's technically just a quantize simulation.
